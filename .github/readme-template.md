## 🎯 Project Goals

AILIS aims to provide a shared mental model for the AI ecosystem, similar to how the OSI model helps us understand networking. Our goals:

- **Clarity**: Common vocabulary for planning and architectural reviews
- **Interoperability**: Clear layer boundaries invite specs and conformance tests  
- **Strategy**: Spot duplication (crowded layers) and white space (under-served layers)
- **Community**: Foster collaboration and discussion around AI system architecture

## 🏗️ Layer Overview

The AILIS framework proposes 16+ functional layers plus cross-cutting planes:

- **L0-L7**: Infrastructure and Model layers (facilities through inference)
- **L8-L15**: Application and Orchestration layers (prompting through governance)  
- **L16**: Application and Domain Logic
- **Cross-cutting**: Control, Management/Observability, and Security planes
