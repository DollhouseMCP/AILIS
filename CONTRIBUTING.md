# Contributing to AILIS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AILIS proposal! This is an early-stage exploration, and we genuinely value all perspectivesâ€”whether supportive, critical, or offering alternatives.

## The Spirit of Contribution

We're not building a standard or specification that needs strict compliance. We're having a conversation about how we might better understand and discuss AI system architectures. Your contribution might be:

- **Questions** that challenge our assumptions
- **Critiques** that highlight problems with the approach
- **Alternatives** that suggest better ways to think about these concepts
- **Examples** that test whether the model holds up in practice
- **Clarifications** that help make the ideas more accessible
- **Connections** to existing work we should learn from

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Thoughts

The easiest way to contribute is to share your perspective:

- **Open an Issue**: Use GitHub issues to share feedback, ask questions, or start discussions
- **Comment on Existing Issues**: Join ongoing conversations
- **Share Use Cases**: Help us understand where this model works or breaks down

### 2. Propose Changes

If you have specific improvements in mind:

- **Documentation**: Clarify explanations, fix errors, add examples
- **Structure**: Suggest better ways to organize the layers
- **Terminology**: Propose clearer names or definitions
- **Scope**: Identify what's missing or what doesn't belong

### 3. Submit Alternative Approaches

We actively welcome competing ideas:

- Create a document in `discussions/alternatives/` describing your approach
- Explain where you think AILIS falls short
- Show how your alternative addresses those shortcomings

## How to Submit Changes

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
3. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
4. **Commit with clear messages** explaining what and why
5. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request
6. **Engage in discussion** - PRs are conversations, not just merges

## Guidelines for Changes

### Tone and Approach

- **Stay humble**: Use "might," "could," "perhaps" rather than "must," "should," "will"
- **Ask questions**: Frame ideas as explorations rather than declarations
- **Acknowledge uncertainty**: It's okay to say "we don't know" or "this might be wrong"
- **Credit others**: Reference existing work and inspirations

### Documentation Style

- **Clear over clever**: Simple language helps more people engage
- **Examples help**: Concrete examples make abstract concepts accessible
- **Acknowledge trade-offs**: Most design decisions have pros and cons
- **Version everything**: Mark documents as drafts with version numbers

### Technical Contributions

If contributing code or schemas:

- Follow existing patterns in the repository
- Include comments explaining non-obvious decisions
- Add examples showing how to use your contribution
- Test your code/schemas with real-world scenarios

## What We're Especially Looking For

### Right Now (v0.1)

- **Reality checks**: Does this model make sense for your use cases?
- **Missing pieces**: What important aspects of AI systems are we not capturing?
- **Better names**: Are there clearer terms for the layers and concepts?
- **Prior art**: What existing work should we reference or build upon?

### Coming Soon

- **Case studies**: Real systems mapped to the AILIS layers
- **Implementation examples**: Code showing how the layers might interact
- **Evaluation criteria**: How do we know if this model is useful?

## Questions or Concerns?

If you're unsure about whether or how to contribute something, please open an issue and ask! We'd rather have the conversation than miss out on your perspective.

## Code of Conduct

We're committed to maintaining a welcoming, inclusive environment. Please:

- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community and the goals of the project
- Show empathy toward other contributors

Harassment, dismissive behavior, or personal attacks will not be tolerated.

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in our documentation. If you prefer to contribute anonymously or pseudonymously, please let us know.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms as the project:
- Documentation: CC-BY 4.0
- Code: Apache 2.0

Thank you for helping explore these ideas with us. Every perspective helps refine and improve our understanding of how AI systems might be better organized and discussed.
