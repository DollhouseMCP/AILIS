# Session Notes: 2025-08-30 - Initial Repository Setup

## Session Overview
**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Primary Goal**: Transform AILIS from initial concept to fully-structured repository with RFC workflow  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully established professional proposal repository structure

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Repository Naming & Positioning
- Renamed from AIS-14+ to **AILIS** (AI Layer Interface Specification)
- Alternative considered: AILIS-16+
- Positioned as humble proposal/exploration, not prescriptive standard
- Emphasized "conversation starter" throughout documentation

### 2. Licensing Strategy
- **Dual licensing approach**:
  - Apache 2.0 for code/implementations
  - CC-BY 4.0 for documentation/specifications
- Rationale: Common pattern for open specifications (OpenAPI, JSON Schema)

### 3. Git Workflow Design
- **RFC-style workflow** chosen over traditional main/develop/feature
- No develop branch - proposals go directly to main when accepted
- Branch structure:
  - `main` - Accepted proposals only
  - `draft/[proposal-name]` - Individual proposals
  - `discussion/[topic]` - Exploratory work
- 4-week minimum review period for proposals

### 4. Content Cleanup
- **Removed all Dollhouse-specific content**
- Used git filter-branch to remove from history entirely
- Moved business-specific docs to separate private repository
- Maintained pure specification focus

## Technical Implementation

### Repository Structure Created
```
/proposals/         - Formal AILIS proposals
/reference/         - Code examples and tools
/studies/           - Real-world case studies
/discussions/       - Community feedback
/.github/           - Templates and workflows
/docs/              - Additional documentation
```

### GitHub Configuration
- Main branch protection with 2-reviewer requirement
- Admin bypass enabled (critical for owner control)
- 10 custom labels for proposal stages
- GitHub Discussions enabled
- Issue templates: Proposals, Feedback, Use Cases
- PR template with comprehensive checklist

### Key Files Created
1. **README.md** - Welcoming, proposal-focused introduction
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Complete RFC workflow documentation
3. **FEEDBACK.md** - Specific areas seeking input
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version tracking setup
5. **LICENSE** & **LICENSE-DOCS** - Dual licensing
6. **.gitignore** - Standard exclusions

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Branch Protection Lock-out Risk
**Solution**: Configured branch protection with admin bypass to ensure owner can always push emergency fixes

### Challenge: Balancing Structure vs Approachability
**Solution**: RFC-style process that's formal enough for serious proposals but not bureaucratic

### Challenge: Historical Cleanup
**Solution**: Used git filter-branch to completely remove Dollhouse-specific content from history

## Review Feedback Implemented
Based on Claude's PR review:
- Fixed README discussions link to use full GitHub URL
- Added commit message examples to CONTRIBUTING
- Added timeline section to proposal template
- Documented branch protection rules explicitly
- Added complete label taxonomy documentation

## Session Notes Infrastructure Added
After initial setup, established documentation infrastructure:
- **CLAUDE.md** created as comprehensive project guide
  - Includes project philosophy and tone guidelines
  - Documents workflow and technical standards
  - Provides context for future Claude sessions
- **Session notes structure** established in `docs/session-notes/`
  - Naming convention: `session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
  - README explaining purpose and format
  - Public documentation for transparency
- **First session notes** documenting this entire setup process

## GitHub Actions Integration
- Claude review bot successfully integrated
- Automated PR reviews working correctly
- All review suggestions successfully implemented

## Next Steps Identified
1. Merge PR #1 to establish baseline ✅ Ready
2. Begin soliciting community feedback
3. Develop first formal proposal as example
4. Reach out to thought leaders in AI infrastructure space
5. Create reference implementation examples

## Lessons Learned
- Clear separation between business and specification repos is essential
- Admin bypass on branch protection prevents lock-out scenarios
- RFC-style workflows work well for specification projects
- Humble positioning encourages more open contribution

## Session Statistics
- Files created: 21 (including templates and session notes)
- Files modified: 11
- Files deleted: 15 (Dollhouse-specific)
- Lines added: ~2,000
- Lines removed: ~750
- Commits: 9
- PR created: #1
- GitHub labels created: 10
- Review cycles: 1 (with successful implementation)

## Context for Future Sessions
The repository is now ready for community engagement. Focus should shift from infrastructure to content - developing example proposals, gathering use cases, and building community around the AILIS concept. The foundation is solid and professional while maintaining the exploratory, humble nature intended.

## Final Status
✅ **PR #1 Ready to Merge** - All feedback addressed, documentation complete, infrastructure solid.
