## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Optional Python Dependencies
**Issue**: Scripts required `toml`, `yaml`, `packaging` modules not available in base Python
**Solution**: 
- Implemented comprehensive try/catch blocks with fallback imports
- Added informative warning messages when modules unavailable  
- Maintained core functionality without optional dependencies
- Workflow installs required packages via pip in CI environment

### Challenge: GitHub API Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Changelog generation could hit API limits with large repositories
**Solution**:
- Added rate limiting detection in error handling (from Tier 1 reviewer feedback)
- Implemented graceful degradation to git-only mode when API unavailable
- Added configurable date-based filtering to reduce API calls
- Provided clear messaging about API limitations and solutions

### Challenge: Template Variable Management
**Issue**: Complex template substitution with multiple data sources
**Solution**:
- Designed modular data gathering functions with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented robust error handling for each data source
- Added fallback content when data sources unavailable
- Created comprehensive logging for troubleshooting template issues

### Challenge: Version Consistency Complexity
**Issue**: Multiple file formats and version reference patterns to support
**Solution**:
- Built extensible architecture with format-specific extractors
- Implemented regex-based pattern matching for various version formats
- Added detailed issue categorization (Error vs. Warning vs. Info)
- Provided specific, actionable recommendations for each issue type
