# Session Notes

This directory contains historical development notes from Claude Code sessions working on AILIS.

## Purpose

Session notes serve as a "sedimentary layer" of project knowledge, documenting:
- Key decisions and rationale
- Technical implementations
- Challenges faced and solutions found
- Project evolution over time
- Context for future development

## Naming Convention

All session notes follow this format:
```
session-notes-YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

Examples:
- `session-notes-2025-08-30-initial-repository-setup.md`
- `session-notes-2025-09-01-first-proposal-draft.md`
- `session-notes-2025-09-15-community-feedback-integration.md`

## What to Include

Each session note should document:

### Required Sections
- **Session Overview** - Date, goals, outcomes
- **Key Decisions Made** - Important choices with rationale
- **Technical Implementation** - What was actually built/changed
- **Next Steps** - What comes next

### Optional Sections
- **Challenges & Solutions** - Problems encountered and how they were solved
- **Review Feedback** - If implementing review comments
- **Lessons Learned** - Insights for future work
- **Session Statistics** - Metrics about changes made
- **Context for Future Sessions** - Important notes for next time

## Why Public?

These notes are intentionally public because:
- They provide transparency about project development
- They help new contributors understand project history
- They document the exploratory nature of AILIS
- They contain no sensitive or private information
- They demonstrate thoughtful, iterative development

## Reading Order

For new contributors or Claude sessions:
1. Start with the most recent 2-3 session notes
2. Review [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for current context
3. Refer to older sessions only as needed for specific history

## Contributing

When ending a significant Claude Code session:
1. Create a new session notes file with proper naming
2. Document the session thoroughly
3. Include it in the session's final commit
4. Reference it in the commit message if relevant
