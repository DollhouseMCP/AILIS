# Case Studies

Real-world examples of systems mapped to the AILIS framework.

## Purpose

Case studies help us:

- Validate the framework against real systems
- Identify gaps and improvements needed
- Provide concrete examples for the community
- Build evidence for the framework's utility


## Submitting a Case Study

1. Use the "Use Case Submission" issue template to share your initial mapping
2. Work with maintainers to develop it into a full case study
3. Case studies can be submitted via PR to this directory


## Format

Each case study should include:

- System overview
- AILIS layer mapping
- What worked well
- Challenges encountered
- Lessons learned


## Confidentiality

- Case studies can be anonymized if needed
- Proprietary details should be abstracted
- Focus on architectural patterns, not implementation secrets


_We're actively seeking case studies. Please contribute yours!_
